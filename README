For help with the makefile type:
$ make help  

The API is specified in src/extern/compsl.h

The scripting language is C like. Files are known as "compartments" and are made 
up of "cubbyholes". A declare cubby is required in each compartment and it specifies 
variables, either vars local to the compartment or global ones. A virtual machine 
("VM") has zero or more compartments. There are currently no internal function calls
implemented, however CSL code can call "user functions", which call C code.
 - See src/test/*.csl for examples of CSL language. 
 - See src/test/test-(comp|torture).c for simple examples of API usage.


API Walkthrough
===============

1. Initialize the virtual machine
        VM *vm=createVM();

2. If desired add functions to the VM
	addPrintLibToVm(vm);
	addDebugLibToVm(vm);
   or
        addFunc(vm, &some_c_function, "cslVisibleName", "float",false,true));
   (see compsl.h for more details)

3. If desired specify global variables, then *fooVar will contain the updated
   value of the CSL variable "foo" after each run. 
        float *fooVar = vm_addFloat(vm,"foo");

4. Instantiate some compartments
	compart *com1=createComp(vm);
	compart *com2=createComp(vm);

5. If desired add some local variables to each compartment, Similar to globals
	int32_t *x = com_addInt(com1,"x");

6. For each compartment compile a CSL file.
        char * cslString = "..";
	ret1 = fileCompile("src/cslFile.csl", com1);
	ret2 = stringCompile(cslString, com2);

7. Run some cubbyholes
	cubbyid = getCubbyID(com1,"init");
	runCubbyhole(com1, cubbyid);
	
	cubbyid = getCubbyID(com2,"init");
	runCubbyhole(com2, cubbyid);

	cubbyid = getCubbyID(com1,"run");
        while(*x!=42)
        	runCubbyhole(com1, cubbyid);
	
8. Clean up
 	destroyComp(com1);
 	destroyComp(com2);
        destroyVM(vm);   



Notes
=====

- You can redeclare globals in different compartments as many times as you like 
  without warning. Actually any variable you can declare multiple times.
- Steps 2 through 6 inclusive can be in any order as long as step 4 is 
  before steps 5 and 6. 
- Lots of math functions are implemented as their own bytecode for 
  efficiency. See src/intern/builtins.h for a list of functions
- The interpreter is not bulletproof, hence its recommended that you do not
  use the interpreter by itself
